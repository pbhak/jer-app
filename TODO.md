This is a list of ideas for things that I want to do, but there is no guarantee that I will do them. Anyone is welcome to help!

- [ ] Integrate with Cloudflare's caching API to cache links and expire the cache when they change.
- [ ] Allow one file link to be stored in multiple places for fallback purposes.
- [ ] Allow editing links that already exist.
- [ ] Add webhook links that have custom behavior, like sending a notification and returning a response.
- [ ] Add a better login system, and maybe allow multiple users to have their own links (probably out-of-scope for now).
- [ ] Store more metadata about links in the database, so we can see things like filesize in the dashboard.
